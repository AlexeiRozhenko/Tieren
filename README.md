Oil production app

**ðŸ‘· Under construction ðŸ‘·**

At the moment, I and a team are developing the Streamlit ML application for predicting oil production for China Oilfield Services Limited (COSL). The application has already been created and uploaded in a private repository, however, for privacy reasons, the data should be updated so that it can be freely used

**Team members:**
1. I assist with Data Science part: help with models, optimize the work of Streamlit. In addition, I do all the visual parts of the work, including polishing Streamlit, writing descriptions and reports
2. Fahimeh Hadavimoghaddam, Associate professor and AI expert, is mostly responsible for designing AI models and providing theoretical background (click [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kZSXOkcAAAAJ&hl=en))
3. Mohammad Ali Sadri, Data Scientist, is involved in the application design (click [here](https://ir.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-ali-sadri-77586b80))
